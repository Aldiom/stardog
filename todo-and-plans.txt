The edge of the system is a stupid idea, and can be replaced with a: when out of system gravity drive that can be activated x distance from star to get back to star system in no time.

if you will travel long enough you will also reach the next solar system, as in stargate travel.

A radar tah will eventualy suport raytracing.

a cource line for a ship that will include gravity pulls.

a particle engine for explotions, engine stuff.

Space mines.

finite engine trust speed

astroids

wormholes/star gates to other systems.

ship lights

every planet own part list

quad trees

better ui

engines with different trust in N

multyplayer

zoom in out option for radar

weapon heat generation

test if solar orbit is posible, <solar orbit is possible did it twice (duality)>

a orbit calculator

someway to target ships, parts and planets

<Duality>

make menu work on fullscreen. only fighter is displayed right left corner. <fixed Duality>

crew:
	add crew? and parts for crew quaters.
	more crew more efficient ship.
	maybe if crew then heal x per x seconds.
bays:
	a part that is mechanic bay
	a part that is the armory
	a part that is a cargo bay
ship:
	every ship a individual mid section that defines what the ship is.
parts:
	blocks with different shapes so that you can better position parts.
	maybe implement hull plating. some things are worth protecting.
universe:
	make mass count more realisticly. it's not just counted in to heavy.

if part die/are killed damage vehicle/ship

particle engine for effects.
