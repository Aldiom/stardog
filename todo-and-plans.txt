The edge of the system is a stupid idea, and can be replaced with a when out of system gravity drive that can be activated x distance from star to get back to star system in no time.

if you will travel long enough you will also reach the next solar system, as in stargate travel.

A radar tah will eventualy suport raytracing.

a cource line for a ship that will include gravity pulls.

a particle engine for explotions, engine stuff.

Space mines.

finite engine trust speed

astroids

wormholes/star gates to other systems.

ship lights

every planet own part list

quad trees

better ui

engines with different trust in N

multyplayer

zoom in out option for radar

weapon heat generation

test if solar orbit is posible,

a orbit calculator

someway to target ships, parts and planets
