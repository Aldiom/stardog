The edge of the system is a stupid idea, and can be replaced with a: when out of system gravity drive that can be activated x distance from star to get back to star system in no time.

if you will travel long enough you will also reach the next solar system, as in stargate travel.

A radar tah will eventualy suport raytracing.

a cource line for a ship that will include gravity pulls.

a particle engine for explotions, engine stuff.

Space mines (easy mode)

posibility to eject parts

some early implementation of space $

finite engine trust speed <it is done, can be tweaked, but is done (Aat)>

engine exaust speed, and engine exaust mass should be variable like other parts (easy mode)

astroids in orbits (hard mode, depends on quad tree, simulatorception)

wormholes/star gates to other systems. (medium mode ?)

ship lights (easy mode once particles is done)

every planet own part list (it is already so ?)

quad trees (hardmode)

better ui (nasty mode ?)

multyplayer <hard mode dependant on code structure, vectors and views split>

zoom in out option for radar <medium mode ?>

weapon heat generation <easy mode>

test if solar orbit is posible, <solar orbit is possible did it twice (duality)>

a orbit calculator <depends on simulator ception>

simulator ception for calculation of trajectorys, targeting and future positions

someway to target ships, parts and planets <easy mode>

<Duality>

make menu work on fullscreen. only fighter is displayed right left corner. <fixed Duality>

crew:
	add crew?
	and parts for crew quaters.					<part added>
	more crew more efficient ship.
	maybe if crew then heal x per x seconds.
bays:
	a part that is mechanic bay
	a part that is weapons bay
	a part that is the armory
	a part that is a cargo bay
ship:
	every ship a individual mid section that defines what the ship is.
	implement droping mines and implement a part for it that does that?
	or only give the destroyer that capability?
	display ship stats closer to the ship like health energy xp bar can stay where it is?
parts:
	blocks with different shapes so that you can better position parts.
	maybe implement hull plating. some things are worth protecting.
universe:
	make mass count more realisticly. it's not just counted in to heavy.
key-handling:
	some key combinations don't work in menu or other parts of the game.
	thus make key-handling for quiting (for example) be interupt based.

if part die/are killed damage vehicle/ship

particle engine for effects.
